This project is a fullstack application created by Michael Sliger.
The purpose of the project is to create a space where any registered*
user can add, delete, and view items in the global store. 

The focus for this project was to create a clean, well rendered, and organized frontend interface that communicates with a backend node/express server.
The frontend should display a straightforward, one-page website with the typical tabs, i.e. Home, About, Contact, and Store.

Users can login to manually set pre-registered users.
Users can only view the store if they are logged in.
Users can add items to the store.
Users can only delete items they posted.

The store items are, on time of publishing, currently satire, but the data could clearly be manipulated in any necessary fashion.

*Registered users are inputted into the database manually.
Registration was not implemented.
